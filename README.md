This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict customer bookings. The process involves exploring and preparing a given dataset, training a predictive model, and evaluating its performance.

The key tasks completed include:

Dataset Exploration and Preparation: This phase involved understanding the dataset's structure, columns, and statistical properties, as well as engineering new features to enhance the model's predictive power.

Machine Learning Model Training: A Random Forest model was trained to predict customer booking outcomes. This model was chosen for its ability to provide insights into feature importance.

Model Evaluation and Findings: The model was evaluated using cross-validation and various metrics. A key output is a visualization showing how each variable contributed to the model's predictive power. The final findings are summarized in a separate presentation slide.
